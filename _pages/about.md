I received the B.S. degree in Communication Engineering from the Shandong University, Weihai, China, in 2024. I am currently pursuing the M.S. degree at the National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing China. My current research is focused on millimeter-wave radar near-field imaging.
